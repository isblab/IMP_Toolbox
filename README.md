# IMP_Toolbox

- See [Modeling with IMP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gaG83RsEBQNemuWwhra0TP0c0jg_WwdeZI1yD_S3RPQ/edit?usp=sharing) for helpful tips while starting.
- To use IMP_Toolbox, clone this repository and add the path to `~/.bash_profile`. You can then use its subdirectories as a module (e.g. `from af_pipeline import AFInput`).
```bash
# replace the path and add it at the end of ~/.bash_profile
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/IMP_Toolbox:$PYTHONPATH
```
- Install the required packages from `requirements.txt`. You need `Python >=3.12`.
```bash
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

**May the light of Durin's day shine upon those who choose this path.**

## Installation

## Pre-processing

Note: the classes for pre-processing and AFpipeline are in `preprocessing` and `af_pipeline`. You need to import and use them for your own systems. See `examples` for example scripts.
