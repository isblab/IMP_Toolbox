# IMP_Toolbox

See [Modeling with IMP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gaG83RsEBQNemuWwhra0TP0c0jg_WwdeZI1yD_S3RPQ/edit?usp=sharing) for helpful tips while starting. 

**May the light of Durin's day shine upon those who choose this path.**

## Installation

## Pre-processing
``pae_to_domains.py`` is a script by Tristan Croll to extract domains from AF predictions. (depending on the value of ``resolution`` parameter, you can get less fragments compared to ``get_high_confidence_region_from_AF2.py``)

## Modeling (not what you may think at first)

## Analysis

## Validation
