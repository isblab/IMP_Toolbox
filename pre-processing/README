Currently there are two ways to extract high-confidence regions from Alphafold. 

1. `get_high_confidence_region_from_af2.py` : uses plDDT and PAE to extract high-confidence regions. All residues with plDDT>70.0 are taken, and PAE domains from this subset are extracted to be modeled as rigid bodies in IMP. 
PAE domains correspond to residues with PAE values < 5 (all vs all residues).
This method is more stringent than the method below. 

2. `Tristan's PAE to domains script` : uses clustering based on only PAE to form domains. One needs to filter for pLDDT in an additional separate script. Less stringent because all PAE values in a domain need not be <5.
