# Pre-processing scripts
This directory contains scripts to aid the preprocessing of the input data to IMP

With these scripts, you can -
- find sequences for your proteins (assuming you have uniprot ids)
- find best structures for your proteins
- perform pairwise sequence alignment
- create job files for AF-server
- find rigid bodies from the monomer predictions

Whatever you need should be in the `input` and what you should get should be in the `output`
