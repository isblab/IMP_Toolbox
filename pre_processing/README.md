# Pre-processing
This directory contains scripts to aid the preprocessing of the input data to IMP

Refer to the respective examples in `IMP_Toolbox/examples`

With these scripts, you can -
- find sequences for your proteins (assuming you have uniprot ids)
- find best structures for your proteins
- perform pairwise sequence alignment
